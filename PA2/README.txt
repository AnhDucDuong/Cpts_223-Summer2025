

1. Does machine processing power affect execution time?
   Yes. Faster computers run the program quicker, especially for larger inputs.

2. Which performs better: std::list or std::vector? Under what conditions?
   `std::vector` is usually faster for small data.
   `std::list` can be better when removing a lot of elements.

3. How does N impact runtime compared to M?
   N affects runtime more than M.
   More cities (N) = more work.
   M just changes which city is removed next.
